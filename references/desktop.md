# Verdesk — desktop (windows & monitors)

`look()` first — on-screen text as collages + layout, almost no pixels. Then act on a UIA control, a piece of visible text, or a box the engine hands you. **`focus_window` before every input burst** — focus drifts.

## Gotchas (read first)
- **Typed a URL / pressed keys, nothing changed.** → The wrong window has OS focus (`set_view_target` ≠ focus; focus drifted). `focus_window(hwnd)` → `look()` to confirm the right window is front → retry. Never input blind after a gap.
- **Click hit the wrong thing.** → You aimed by eye. Use `dry_run:true`; the crosshair shows the exact pixel before you commit.
- **`look()` shows the wrong app / a black frame.** → Wrong surface. `list_surfaces()` + `set_view_target(...)`.
- **`click_text` matched nothing.** → On-screen text isn't literally what you typed (case/whitespace). Use a shorter unique substring, or `look(mode:"detail")` then `click_in_rect` with `dry_run`.

## Coordinate model (read once)
On a window surface every `(x,y)` is **relative to that window** — `(0,0)` = the top-left of its **frame — the exact frame `look()` reports, title bar included** (so a coordinate read from `look()`/`read_text`/UIA lands on the same pixel when clicked; the invisible resize border is not part of it). These are your **fixed cords**: stable. Verdesk converts them to absolute screen (real cords) to send input and keeps them valid even if the window moves — via the automatic anchor. Two different things, do not confuse them (the #1 cause of "nothing happened"): **`set_view_target`** = what you SEE + the coordinate frame; **`focus_window`** = OS keyboard focus = where input LANDS.

## Pick what you see — context
- `list_surfaces()` → monitors + windows, each with a `spec`. Each window also has `state` (`normal|minimized|maximized|hidden`), `size` (visible frame w×h; absent when minimized), `process` (owning exe) and `running` (`false` = a Store app that is **closed or suspended**, not told apart). `hidden` windows (Windows keeps an empty frame for a closed Store app; `hidden_reason`) are listed but marked: `set_view_target` and `look` on them fail — skip them. A `minimized` window can be targeted (to restore it) but `look()` fails until you `set_window_size({state:"normal"})` or `focus_window`.
- `set_view_target(spec)` → `monitor` | `monitor:N` | `window:0xHWND` | `window-title:"text"`. Switches what you SEE + the frame. Does NOT move keyboard focus. Invalidates the buffer + UIA inventory.

## See — `look(zone?, want?, mode?)`
Returns: `frame` (viewport/grid/title/freshness) · `text[]` collages `{id, kind, text, bbox_abs}` (the box you feed to `click_in_rect`/`learn_button`) · `layout[]` zones · `macros[]` (Pro: trains matching the screen NOW, closest first — autocomplete for tasks).
- `want` = subset of `["text","layout","visual"]` (default `["text","layout"]`, no pixels; add `"visual"` only to see shape).
- `mode` = `glance` (cheap default) | `detail` (finer text).
- **`button:true`** on a text entry = Verdesk saw a real button (a framed or filled box) around it, not just short text. An entry with `text:""` and `button:true` is an **icon button**: no text, but clickable — `click_collage(id)`; to see what the icon is, `look({zone:{kind:"around_collage",id}, want:["visual"]})`.
- `zone` = `{kind:"all"}` · `{kind:"rect",rect:{x,y,w,h}}` · `{kind:"cells",ids:[…]}` · `{kind:"around_collage",id}` · `{kind:"around_layout_zone",id}` · `{kind:"selector",css}` (resolves ANY element's bbox — even a non-interactive `<div>`/drop-zone).
- **Why not read pixels for text:** images come light (good for shape: icons, layout). For TEXT use the text layer or `read_text` — at medium res a model hallucinates words.

## Read exact text — `read_text(target)`
Deterministic plain text. `target` is exactly one of `{kind:"region",rect:{x,y,w,h}}` (a pixel rectangle in the active target's frame — the coordinates `look()` reports) · `{kind:"cells",selector:{kind:"all"}}` · `{kind:"cells",selector:{kind:"list",ids:[{col,row}]}}` (grid cells of the active buffer). **`elements` is NOT supported — it always returns an error, on any target** (in the browser use `browser_get_text`). Prefer over reading an image. The window title is already in `look().frame.title`. Long numbers/codes can misread (`8.511.708`→`8.511.7e8`, `O`↔`0`) — when a value MUST be exact, `screenshot` it zoomed and read the digits off the enlarged image.
**The EXACT text of a desktop field** (an edit or combo box) is its **`value`** in `list_uia_elements` — not `look()`'s text, which can misread ordinary words too (measured on Notepad: `look()` misread the words, the UIA `value` of the same field returned the exact text, line breaks `\r\n` included). `value` is the control's current text; it is absent when the control has no value or it is empty.

## See one thing as an image — `screenshot({target|rect, max_dim?})`
One rendered crop for what the text layer can't give: an icon (by shape), a chart, a custom-drawn region. `max_dim` = zoom (upscales up to 4×). Monitor-agnostic — Verdesk's own rendering, not an OS grab.

## UIA — semantic controls (no pixels, survives moves)
- `list_uia_elements({visible_only?, max_depth?, actionable_only?})` → `{elements, returned, truncated, origin:{x,y}, note?}`. Each element: `auto_NNN` id, `name`, `automation_id`, `control_type`, `bbox_abs`, supported patterns, tree depth. **`bbox_abs` is relative to `origin`** (the window's frame top-left — the same frame `look()` reports — or the monitor's top-left), not screen-absolute despite the name — feed it as-is to `click_at`; screen point = `origin` + bbox. `visible_only` (default true) skips offscreen. `max_depth` (default 8) — raise it for deep Electron/Office trees (15+ levels) if a target control is missing. `actionable_only` (default true) drops nameless, non-actionable containers/decoration — the noise a browser chrome or a complex app pads the tree with by the hundreds; pass `false` only to see the raw unfiltered tree. Hard cap 500 elements — `truncated:true` always comes with a `note` explaining what to narrow, never a silent cutoff. **`auto_NNN` ids are valid only until the NEXT `list_uia_elements` call** (it resets the store) — don't cache them across calls.
- `act_uia({id, action})` — `action.kind` ∈ `invoke | set_value(+value) | toggle | select | expand | collapse`. Its ids also feed clicks & waits. ex: `act_uia({id:"auto_07", action:{kind:"invoke"}})`.

## Act — the click ladder (top→down, most robust first)
1. `act_uia({id, action})` — semantic UIA when `get_capabilities().has_uia`. No pixels → survives moves.
2. `click_text(query, occurrence?)` — a visible substring from `look().text`. `occurrence` ∈ `first|last|nth|all`. ex: `click_text("Pinceles")`. Clicks the center of the matching WORD(S) (several words = their union), not of the whole text block; `clicked` returns the rect pressed.
3. `click_collage(id)` — a collage from the last `look()`.
4. `click_in_rect({x,y,w,h, x_pct?, y_pct?, button?, dry_run?})` — a precise box. Center by default. ex: `click_in_rect({x:387,y:100,w:39,h:8})`.
5. `click_at({x,y, button?})` — pixel-perfect, last resort.

`button` ∈ `left`(default)|`right`(context menu)|`middle`. **`dry_run:true`** on `click_in_rect` fires NO click — returns `{x,y,resolved_rect}` + an 80×80 crop with a magenta crosshair on the exact pixel. Free; use whenever unsure, then repeat with `dry_run:false`.

**Other input:** `type_text(text)` · `press_key({key, ctrl?, alt?, shift?, win?})` · `scroll({direction, amount_px})` · `drag_path({points:[{x,y}…], button?, hold_ms?})` (press→move→release; drawing/sliders/drag&drop — points are viewport coords).

## Clipboard — `clipboard(text?)`
The Windows clipboard as plain text (get/set on the same call). Omit `text` to READ the current content → `{text: string|null}` (null if the clipboard has no text) — the way to pull text out of an app with no UIA/DOM: select it in the app, `press_key({key:"c", ctrl:true})`, then read here. Pass `text` to WRITE it, overwriting whatever was there → `{ok:true}` — pair with `press_key({key:"v", ctrl:true})` to move text into a field in one paste instead of `type_text`ing it character by character (slow, and can corrupt long strings). Works with real Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V from any other app, not just Verdesk's own writes.

## Window & coordinates
- `focus_window(hwnd_hex)` → OS keyboard focus. **Re-call before every input burst** (focus drifts). On a multi-tab browser window, this brings the WINDOW forward but can NOT select a specific tab — Win32 has no per-tab HWND, so it lands on whichever tab the browser last had active. Not fixable from here; if you need a specific tab, use the browser tier's own `browser_select_tab` instead of `set_view_target`+`focus_window` on a desktop-tier browser window.
- `get_window_geometry()` → `{x,y,w,h, window_rect, client, monitor, minimized, maximized, corners, any_corner_offscreen}`. `x,y,w,h` = the visible frame `look()` and clicks use (title bar included); `window_rect` = outer rect with the invisible resize border; `client` = below the title bar.
- `set_window_size({width?,height?, state?})` → resize the CLIENT area (below the title bar; the click frame is the client plus the title bar) and/or change the show-state; no move / no focus steal. `width`+`height` restore the size a train was recorded at. `state` ∈ `maximized|minimized|normal` — applied BEFORE any resize, and deliberately ignores width/height when given (maximizing a specific size makes no sense). Pass width+height, state, or both — at least one required. `state:"normal"` runs `SW_RESTORE`, which returns to whatever state preceded the last minimize (if you minimized a maximized window, `"normal"` gives you back maximized, not windowed — that's Win32, not a bug).
- `set_look_zone(zone)` / `clear_look_zone()` / `get_look_zone()` → a default zone for bare `look()` calls (NOT keyboard focus).

## Wait on a condition, not a clock
- `wait({ms})` — sleep (cap 60000); for a KNOWN wait (e.g. a person still typing — see `user_changed`); never in place of a condition.
- `wait_for_uia({id, condition, timeout_ms?})` — `condition.kind` ∈ `exists | enabled | visible | value_contains{substring} | value_equals{value} | toggle_state{state}`.
- `wait_for_uia_property_change({id, property, timeout_ms?})` — `property` ∈ `value | toggle_state | enabled | offscreen | name`.

## Advanced — buffer reset, cross-session memory, profiles (rarely needed)
The visual buffer auto-resets on a big screen change (title/URL/readyState, >40% DOM, >60% cells); you rarely manage it — check `look().frame.freshness`. If you must:
- Buffer control: `force_reset` (hard-reset now — archives the buffer to history first, so nothing is lost) · `pin_buffer`/`unpin_buffer` (veto/re-enable the NEXT automatic reset — use before a known big change you don't want to lose context over, e.g. opening a modal).
- Cross-session visual memory: `query_history({zone, threshold?})` — "have I seen something like THIS before?" `zone` is the same selector as `look` (e.g. `{"kind":"around_collage","id":"..."}` right after a `look()`); the server fingerprints it, you handle no hashes. Returns `snapshots` (best first) with `url`, `archived_at`, `matched_cells`, `same_position_cells` (strong signal) and `avg_distance`; empty = never seen. Plain-background cells carry no information and are excluded: read `matched_cells` against `zone_cells - excluded_cells`, not `zone_cells`. Memory is what `look()` showed, archived on `set_view_target` or a reset. `threshold` = max Hamming distance (default 8, lower = stricter). Read-only, survives resets/navigation.
- Profiles (saved modulation recipes — resolution/quality/color_mode/threshold/levels/brightness/contrast/gamma): `list_profiles` · `load_profile` · `save_profile` · `update_profile` · `rate_profile` · `delete_profile`. No MCP tool currently applies a loaded profile's full param set for you — it's mainly a persisted recipe record, also used by the desktop Lab UI (a human-facing panel, not something you drive).
